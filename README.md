# WineQuality
 
This project utilizes machine learning regression techniques to predict the quality of wines based on various features, including alcohol percentage, density, color (white or red), and pH. Two regression models, decision tree regression and random forest regression, were implemented to analyze and predict the wine quality. The goal of this project is to explore the effectiveness of these models and provide insights into how to improve the prediction accuracy for wine quality.
